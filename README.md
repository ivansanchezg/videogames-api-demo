# videogames-api-demo

This project is an example of a small microservice. It represents a small API for videogame consoles. The server is developed in [Spark Java](http://sparkjava.com/). The user interface uses Swagger UI. 

The project is deployed and run locally. The data in this API is only handled in memory and not in a database, which means that it will be reset everytime you restart the server.

## Build and run the server locally

## Build and run the ui locally
